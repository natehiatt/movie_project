# Movie Industry Data Analysis
## Overview
Our firm is advising a company in the venture into the movie industry. They have tasked us with finding trends and relationships that may guide their decisions regarding how to enter the industry. Such exploration may include recommendations on movie type, who to hire, when to make movies, how much to spend, etc., all in order to maximize profits.
